# `FaustLive` Directory `fldir`

This is a temporary directory made to work with FaustLive until we understand how to
properly set it up to make it work with files distributed in multiple directories.

## Usage

```bash
$ make
```

This will create all the symbolic links necessary to work with `FaustLive`.
Then open any of the `*_exe.dsp` files in this directory to start a specific
process.

```bash
$ make clean
```

will perform all cleanup duties.
